**READING STILL IN PROGRESS**

I picked this book up partly as a refresher for a job interview and also hoping to learn some new things along the way as well. The book provides a good hands on approach following imagined case studies of companies. It shows the first steps of getting a feel for data using Pandas .describe() and histograms. It moves onto using Matplotlib to visualise data and plot regression lines. Then onto sampling and A/B testing.
