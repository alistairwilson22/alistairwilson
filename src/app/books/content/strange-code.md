**READING STILL IN PROGRESS**

The first section of this book goes through the history of programming languages and what different languages introduced to the world of computer science. That section alone is worth the book, there's code examples of each of the highlighted programming languages to show how they work and get a feel for it's idosyncraties. I was looking for an article on the topic but didn't find anything satisfying. The early programming languages switched between structured (using control flow and loops) vs unstructured (like Basic with GOTO line 100 for loops). I'd come across unstructured, but it's funny how that debate defined an era of programming langauges and is now settled and it's interesting to see in the future what other contested ways of working will just be settled. 

I've paused on this one because there's some other topics I'm finding more relevant to work and this is much more of a hobby book. I'll not pick it up again until after I've finished the seven languages in seven weeks book for example.
