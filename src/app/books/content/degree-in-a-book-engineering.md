The depth in the book is abit sparce for a degree, but it does cover in broad terms alot of the fundamentals. I'd say it's a good series especially for teenagers trying to decide what direction they might want to go, or for adults with curiousity about other disciplines. It starts off very much school level, but alot of the physics I learnt at school never felt very cohesive or clear how the parts fitted together.

Important concept: Energy can't be created, it can only be transferred. You also lose energy in transformation.
