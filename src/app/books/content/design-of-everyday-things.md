I read this along time ago so my memory is hazy.

I have a strong memory of a design book with 4 ways to improve the design of a remote control:
  -  Remove (Get rid of unnecessary features. Simplify.)
  -  Hide (Obscure advanced features. They're there for advanced users, and hidden for most)
  -  Organise (Reorder group like things together)

I think that was this book, but it might have been a different one. Anyway I enjoyed it at the time, the rest is lost to my memory and I currently don't typically re-read books.
