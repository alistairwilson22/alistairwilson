**READING IN PROGRESS**

I have high hopes for this. I took a look at Ken Buck's *Test Driven Development*, but it was too narrowly focused on Java to be usefully applicable to the main use cases of testing I have. This book works with Javascript and Python, which I use regularly, and Go. Because the tests are shown in a variety of languages it's much easier to see what parts are universal and what is specific to the language in question. The book has shown up I'll need to spend more time with Go, it's a powerful language and I can see development trends going it's way (along with Rust). I can follow along well enough with Go, but there's enough nuances to it that I'd benefit from a learning Go structured standalone book.
