**READING STILL IN PROGRESS**

*Grokking Simplicity* covers "Functional Thinking", which is how to approach programming from a Functional Programming (FP) perspective.

Separate and distinguish code based on:
  -  Actions (code that does something, eg send an email)
  -  Calculations (code that calculates or manipulates data)
  -  Data (a fact)

FP prefers Data to Calculations, and prefers Calculations to Actions
