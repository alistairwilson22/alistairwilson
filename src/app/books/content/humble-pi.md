It seems strange that a book on PHP that's over a decade old is called Modern PHP.

I was looking for a PHP book to see if there were some general tips and tricks to pick up, but found the resources are pretty slim picking. I wonder if that's the reason people think PHP is dead, because resources for PHP are all directed towards CMS or Laravel or perhaps Symfony. I wonder if with more training resources it would be more readily adopted.

It's quite interesting reading a tech book that's dated as a window into the era though. Composer was a big thing when the book was written, but pretty standard feature now. Some of the PHP features have more modern updates but some tips and tricks are still relevant.
