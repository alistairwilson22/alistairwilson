I decided to learn Java partly because I could see it paired with alot of fullstack roles and partly to help read *Clean Code* since the intro to *Clean Code* banged on about the importance of it's code samples (written in Java) and how they should be interogated and analysed.

I'm glad I put the time in to learning Java, it's given me a greater appreciation of it's influence in PHP and Typescript.

I feel alittle torn over *Heads First Java*. It's intended to be a written in a goofy way and it's aimed at beginners... and I don't really feel like a beginner programmer... but it's alot less dry than *Java in a Nutshell* which I started about the same time and abandoned... so it's definitely a great book series for aspiring developers. It's also a great suppliment to other learning methods as it explains alot of concepts in a conversational question and answer style to point out some of the finer aspects of the subject.

Anyway my takeaways from this book, a better understanding of the following topics:  
- Encapsulation  
- Interfaces  
- Abstract classes  
- Static classes  

It's a good start, I'd quite like to spend some time with the Spring framework at some point and have a Java project in my lab but that's probably going to be a few years down the line I suspect. Also another takeaway... html and css to style an interface has alot going for it compared to Java Swing. Python Turtle Graphic GUIs were more fun than Java Swing too.
