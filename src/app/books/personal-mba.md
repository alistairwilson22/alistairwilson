I was interviewed for a part funded MBA scheme after university, but I'm ultimately glad I didn't go down that route. This was straight out of university and I was ready to work rather than study. Also I don't think I was really the right kind of person to make the most of an MBA, despite being social it's taken many years for me to feel comfortable talking to someone with a business agenda at wake. I'm only more comfortable with networking now as I take the view that I can have a decent chat with someone, and if more comes out of it great but it's really unlikely so I'm not even going in expecting anything other than a chat. Remove the agenda, hey presto I'm comfortable again.

Anyway I picked up the book to see what I was missing. Can you do an MBA in a book? No. Well you can get the theory from the book, but an MBA (and a computer science degree for that matter) is part theory and part practice. So I got alot of the theory of the MBA from the book, but didn't get hands on practice making business viability plans and networking and all the extra stuff that actually makes an MBA more valuable than just sitting in lectures. Similar can probably be said for my reading of Computer Science books, they're great and you can get alot of theory and a good grounding from them... but you need to practice really and apply to real problems to really get it.
