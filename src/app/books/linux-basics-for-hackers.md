*Linux Basics For Hackers* is a short and sweet book. The book does live upto it's title more than I expected. It is more about Linux than Hacking, and it does cover the Linux Basics rather than going super advanced. So I came into the book with perhaps the wrong expectations thinking there'd be some interesting hacking scripts disected when really it's an overview of core Linux commands from the lense of how you might use them when doing exploratory hacking of a system.

It was a decent overview of Linux commands, most of which I was familar with already coming into the book.

I was going to get Kali Linux set up and coding along at one point, but found myself just reading through it and following what was going on without much trouble. I would like to experiment (legally) with Metasploit at some point but that'll likely come another time.

The things I did get out of it were perhaps a view on how hackers might use some of the commands

Main things that stood out:
* ifconfig - checking the network
* iwconfig - checking wifi networks
* msfconfig - metasploit commands
* Raspberry Spy Pi - rasperry pi + camera addon connected to via SSH and set to take pictures on loop
* rootkits - malware that takes control of a Linux kernel.
