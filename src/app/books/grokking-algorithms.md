*Grokking Algorithms* is a nice short book that goes over standard data structure and search algorithms. I read it because I needed to brush up more on my tree algorithm knowledge. The book has nice simple language and clear cartoonie images to cover the thousand words it otherwise misses out on.

It's a good refresher, I needed to get a better grip on tree algorthims by actually coding and implementing them, so the book falls short on that regard because it's just a book and it can't code for me. Sad times. So yes more tree algorithm practice was needed by me instead, alas. But hey it's a good read to get a conceptual view of what to code before getting more of that practice in.

The thing I was hoping it would spend more time looking into was [Karp's 21 NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems), which it didn't. So I'll need to find something else to go into that in more detail at some point.
