This is a very quick read, and it's not far off a long blog article on the topic, or a short online text only course with some questions/challenges. But I tend to skim read blogs, so having it in a book format helped me.

The author covers all the basics of Shell Scripting, creating files, adding variables, making functions, executing files.

I saw someone say it took them from no knowledge to comfortably shell scripting in just a weekend, it is about a 2 day read but I don't think it'll make you a master. It'll give you enough to go on and make your own experiments. What it is lacking from being short is examples of what you might want to use shell scripting for in the first place which is where a book like *Linux Basics for Hackers* or *Wicked Cool Shell Scripts* or something on hands on DevOps would take over. Good starter on the subject to dip your toe in the water though.
