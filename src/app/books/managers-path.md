**READING IN PROGRESS**

I didn't think a huge amount of the start of the book as it starts back at the beginning of a career with some advice that perhaps might have been useful as I started. But as it goes on there is more to the book and some good management ideas to incorporate.

Tips:
  -  Create new hire onboarding docs. Ask new hires to follow *and update* these docs during their onboarding.
  -  Ask new hires what motivates them, do they like public or private praise, how do they like 1-1s, to get a feel for how to manage them going forward.
  -  Ask new hire's what their impressions were after 90 days. They'll provide a semi external perspective that'll be useful for informing making positive changes.
  -  Often managers neglect 1-1s, doing so prevents you knowing when someone is becoming unmotivated and might look elsewhere at a bad time for you.
  -  Take and keep shared notes during 1-1s so you can review during performance reviews.
  -  Delegation isn't the same as removing responsibility. When you delegate you should still be involved in a project, just not micro manage. The difference is that with delegation you discuss with the project lead what the project lead needs to do, check in with them, but most importantly **give them autonomy**. If they need you to step in and take over (some aspects), that's ok but it should be mutually agreed / initiated by the existing project manager.
  -  When writing up performance reviews try to think of concrete examples for any point. If you don't have a concrete example, it could just be a bias.
  -  Performance reviews tend to skip the strengths. Don't neglect the strengths as you want to praise and reinforce positive behaviours.
