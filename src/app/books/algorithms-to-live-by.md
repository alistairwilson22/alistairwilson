**READING STILL IN PROGRESS**

This has taken me awhile to read, because there's so much in it to unpack. There are a crazy amount of references in here but it approaches algorithms and modern data and computer science in a way I've not seen before.

This book is almost like a Malcolm Gladwell or *Freakonomics* book in terms of how cutting edge academic research (even if quite alot of it is also centuries old) can be applied to every day life. But this is in the domain of computer science which typically alot of social science passes over in favour of the social sciences.
