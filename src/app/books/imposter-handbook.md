I came across *The Imposters Handbook* as a recommendation from a code tutorial in the early stages of me getting serious about development. So imposters handbook introduced me to a lot of topics I hadn't come across before, especially complexity theory, design patterns and big data from a development problem perspective.

It's a good primer, and covers a broad range but not in very great depth. It's written with an audience of developers who've been in the profession awhile and had exposure to some of the ideas, but haven't really dug deep into them. So if you've not had a background exposure, the commentary is alittle light. It's abit like notes he's written for his own understanding and then shared... in fact that's almost exactly what it is as he didn't originally set out to write a book but more to make sure he had a good understanding of what is taught at Computer Science schools.

Anyway I found it useful as it presented ideas for me which, while they haven't all sunk in deep have at least given me ideas of what to look into further. There's more value I can eek out of complexity theory than I have so that's something I'll have to read more on in the future.

Something I'll take away to help understand the difference between a byte, kilobyte, gigabyte, terrabyte:  
  - 1 thousand seconds = around 17 minutes  
  - 1 million seconds = around 12 days  
  - 1 billion seconds = around 32 years  
  - 1 trillion seconds = around 316 centuries
