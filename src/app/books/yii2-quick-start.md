I picked up this book to help get to grips with a new PHP framework I'll be working with commercially starting Jan 2024.

It's a decent start, although the topics covered are pretty much identical to what I found from a YouTube crash course.

Sadly there isn't as much learning resources out there for Yii framework as there are for Laravel or Symfony. Which is a shame as Yii has alot of potential and it's considered in the top 5 PHP frameworks, it's just that the PHP frameworks are dwarfed by Laravel, Symfony and CMSes like Drupal and Wordpress. So I had a much better learning experience with both Laravel, Drupal and Wordprss just because there's more resources out there.

Yii2's advantages are simplicity, speed and security. It's a lightweight framework which gives alot of freedom when it comes to implementation. I'll have a better feel for Yii when I've done more work for it. So far I prefer Laravel but it's got potential and I'm sure when I've had more time on it I'll grow to love it more.
