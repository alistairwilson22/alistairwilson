## What is it?

*alistairwilson.co.uk* is a website where I keep track of professional books I've read and personal coding projects. It might evolve to also showcase interesting commercial projects I've worked on in the future, that'll depend on what I *can* talk about here.

## Core Features

- Professional book reviews
- DIY project portfolio

## See it in action

You can just look around the website here... but here's some screenshots

## How was it made?  

I used Next with TypeScript for the website. The articles are written in .md Markdown language so they're portable if I change website platform.

## Takeaways  

It's quite tricky to design with a blank slate and no sounding board. I essentially started adding content and then built the rest of the site around that. Next.js worked really well, TypeScript added some extra complexity but there weren't many cases where the data types were needed so it wasn't much bother.
